                    <p>After putting the website address into Pingdom.com. Here are my 
                        thoughts about improving the site performance usability. Firstly, by 
                        lowering the number of pictures that are on the site, because according 
                        to the "content size by content type" table. Images take up 80% of the 
                        whole thing, which in the end makes it slow down because with all 
                        the high-resolution Images loading all at once when you click to open 
                        it will, eventually start slowing the site down. Secondly, redirecting 
                        users to new pages. Having a lot of links like images or words that 
                        will bring users to new pages are good and useful, but at the same 
                        time, it could also slow down the speed of the website.

                    <p>After going through WAVE with the Brookfield Zoo site address, here are 
                        my thoughts about improving accessibility. Firstly, the most errors 
                        that came up right away were that 10 linked images were missing their 
                        alternative text, which is easy enough to fix and helps the site 
                        maintain its professional look even if the site or images don't work. 
                        Secondly, like the usability above, limit the number of redirects. 
                        Having too many links that go to the same page could confuse users when 
                        they are trying to find something else as there are 6 alerts of a 
                        redundant link on the site.
